1. What is variable?
Vaiables are containers for storing data values, like number  and characters

Variable is treated as a name or identifier that indicates the memory location where it stores the value

# number type Variable
age = 45
roll = 2

# string type variable:
name = "Showrab Paul"
course = "python by pithron"

# list typed variable
menuList = ["home", "blog", "Login"]

# Types of variables

# A VAriable must start with a letter or the underscore character
a= 10
_ = 60

# A Variable name can not start with a number
1a = 40 #--------> Wrong
2_ =90 #-------Wrong

# VAriables names are case sensitive( age, Age, AGE are different types of variables)
